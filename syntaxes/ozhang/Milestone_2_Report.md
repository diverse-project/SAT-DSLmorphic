## Rules not expressed in grammar

* Axioms are only composed of down-cased letter, to avoid any confusion with operator.
* Parentheses are mandatory when introducing an operator, so that there cannot be any interpretation mistake.

## Comparison between MM1 and MM2

* Parentheses are not mentioned in MM1, but they are mandatory in MM2.
* MM2 specifies the concrete format operators and axioms' name.
