* Well-formed rules not expressed in the grammar (and worth checking)
  There is some well-formed rules we should check for the well use of
  the grammar.
  - name of the atom should be unique and not confusing with the names
    of the operator
* Comparison of MM2 & MM1
  
  MM1 here : [link]
  MM2 here : [link]
  
  We guess that the general structure of the metamodel are
  similar. But there are some differences :
  - new Objects such as ~Formula~ and ~File~;
  - we created in MM1 abstract classes, interfaces, \ldots whereas in
    MM2, all classes are concrete;
  - in MM1, ~Var~ was a kind of « atom » whereas there is a real «
    atom » in MM2 which is ~Atom~;
  - operators are not sub-classes but attribute of the class ~ExprUn~
    and ~ExprBin~ (~EString~);
  - ~ExprBin~ has a left and right argument. In MM1, we wrote [2..2]
    expr` instead of, `[0..1] exprR (reps. exprL)` in MM2;
